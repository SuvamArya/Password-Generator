# Password Generator in ReactJs
Simple password generator in ReactJS using Tailwind CSS for styling and React Hooks for giving the functionality. Added Copy button to directly copy the generated password to clipboard.
<br>
- useState hook for maintaining state for inclusion/exclusion of numbers/symbols.
- useEffect hook for generating a new password for each state change.
- useRef hook for referencing the generated password and selecting it while copying.
- useCallback hook for caching the password generator function to improve performance. 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
